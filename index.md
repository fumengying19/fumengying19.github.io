## Biography
---
I am a master degree student of [PRISDL](https://ucassdl.cn/) in the School of Electronic, Electrical and Communication Engineering, [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://english.ucas.ac.cn/), advised by Prof. [Qixiang Ye](http://people.ucas.ac.cn/~0007279?language=en). I got a B.E. degree in Electronic Information at China Agricultural University School, in June 2019.

My research interests include computer vision and machine learning, specifically for active learning, classification and detection.
